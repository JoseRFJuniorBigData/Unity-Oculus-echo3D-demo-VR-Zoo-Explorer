This is the mightiest creature of the jungle--the tiger!
Did you know that tigers don't like to eat vegetables?
Well, I sure as hell didn't! 
Because of that, I started planting carrots all around the exhibit.
I need to go back and remove them... But I'm actually really scared of tigers.
Can you go and weed out the carrots for me? There should only be 5 carrots in the exhibit.
Approach them and you will automatically remove them.
And beware of the tiger! If it touches you, you'll get a game over, so stealthily move around it.
Stay here and complete this minigame if you are an absolute champion!
